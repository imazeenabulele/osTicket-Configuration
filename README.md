<h2>Configuration Steps</h2>
<p>
I will start off by navigating through the OsTicket platform using the objectives above to show some of the major functions that are utilized. The first function we would look at is "Roles".

1. CONFIGURE ROLES
  
Roles are important in managing and organizing support teams effectively. They help structure permissions, responsibilities, and access to various parts of the help desk system, allowing for better workflow and security. This way, each person has the appropriate level of access, responsibility, and control over the system

<p>
To create a Role, navigate to the "Admin Panel" tab at the top right corner, go on to click on "Agents" > "Roles" > "Add New Role"
We'll call the role we are creating "Supreme User"

</p>
<p>
Navigate to "Tickets" and "Tasks" tab. For the purpose of having seamless explaination of osTicket usage, I'll assign all permissions to the role being created. (NOTE: This is not standard practice, except it is required by the organisational policies). Once that is done, click "Add role" to create the role

2. CONFIGURE DEPARTMENTS

The department to be created is the SysAdmin department. This department is responsible for managing anfd maintaining the IT infrastructure for an organization. They would set up and maintain servers, set up and maintain user accounts, monitor cybersecurity threats, respond to IT issues and troubleshooting system problems
